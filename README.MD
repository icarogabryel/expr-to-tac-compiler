# Expression to TAC Compiler

This is a simple expression to TAC compiler written in Python. It takes an expression as input and generates the three address code for the expression.

## Grammar

This compiler is based on a simple expression grammar that have '+' and '*' operators, and parentheses to change the precedence of the operators. Due to left recursion, the grammar is modified to remove the left recursion. The modified grammar is as follows:

```
Expr  -> Term Expr'
Expr' -> + Term Expr' | ε
Term  -> Factor Term'
Term' -> * Factor Term' | ε
Factor -> (Expr) | number
```

## How to run

To run the compiler, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, you can run the compiler by:
1. Putting a 'input.txt' file  in the same directory as the 'main.py' file.
2. running the following command in the terminal:

```
python main.py
```

The compiler will read the expression from the 'input.txt' file and generate the TAC in the 'output.txt' file.

## Example

For the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, the TAC generated by the compiler is:

```
t1 = 3 * 4
t0 = 2 + t1
```
